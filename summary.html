The implementation of this snake game did cause me some troubles to develop mainly having the snake segments continue to move with the head after they had been made when the snake lengthened. Besides that the implementation of other features were not to difficult. Since I am using a grid of size 21x21 to keep track of the position of the snake having the the game detect whether the snake is touching the wall simply requires that I check if the head of the snake has an x or y of 0 or 22 which is out of bounds. To input the movement depending on the input of the player the cordinates of the head will have a 1 added or subracted from the  or y and redrawn in the new position. To stop the snake from being able to go backwards into itself before a new direction is input an if statment makesure to check the current direction its moving. Having the snake and food be in random positions is just having a random x and y generated between 1 and 21 while checking that the space is empty if it isn't then a new corrdinate is generated. And having the head tail and body different colors was just done in CSS.
